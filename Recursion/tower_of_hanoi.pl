# The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
# 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
# 2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
# 3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
# The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.
